# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, which I built for fun to showcase my skills and projects.

## About This Project

I created this website as a way to present myself and my work in a professional and visually appealing manner. It includes sections about me, my skills, my projects, and a way to contact me.

## Technology Used

- **HTML**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **JavaScript**

## Known Issues

For some reason which I haven't found yet, the website looks different when viewed locally compared to when it is deployed. I'm working on figuring out why this happens.
